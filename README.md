# kbpybot
Another Keybase Bot framework in Python

# Idea
Make a Keybase Bot with minimal API Interaction that is extendable via subclasses of the main BaseTeam
Allow the bot to be configured more precisely using modules

# Problems thus far
My main loop is currently causing the Keybase process to devour CPUs

# Running
To run the bot, you must supply a bot_name to the main.py and run the bot on a machine/user with Keybase logged in
